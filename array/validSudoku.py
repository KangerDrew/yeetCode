# For rules 1 & 2:
# We can use a hashset set to validate whether each row/column is valid
# sudoku. To make the algorithm runtime efficient, we will be using two
# default dictionaries (hash map), where the keys will be the index of
# column/row, and the key value will be a hash set that keeps track of
# what number was on a row/column.

# For rule 3:
# Like we did for previous rules...
