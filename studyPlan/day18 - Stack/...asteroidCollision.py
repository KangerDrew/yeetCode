# Use stack data structure to store incoming asteroids.

# HINT: Collision will only occur, if during the for loop, we encounter (incoming asteroid)
# a negative asteroid and our previous asteroid value was positive!!
# Furthermore, if the incoming asteroid is positive and recent asteroid was negative, they
# will not collide since they would have already be moving away from one another!
