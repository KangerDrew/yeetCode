# When we calculate the total sum, we need to ensure that we can  create a
# sub-array that can reach half the total sum. This means that the remaining
# value(s) will form another sub-array who's sum will be half the total sum!

# If total sum is odd value, and our values only consist of integers, we can't
# get sub-array who's sum is half the total sum!
