# Statement: Given a string expression representing arbitrarily nested ternary expressions,
# evaluate the expression, and return the result of it.

# You can always assume that the given expression is valid and only contains digits,
# '?', ':', 'T', and 'F' where 'T' is true and 'F' is false. All the numbers in the
# expression are one-digit numbers (i.e., in the range [0, 9]).

# The conditional expressions group right-to-left (as usual in most languages),
# the result of the expression will always evaluate to either a digit, 'T' or 'F'.
