# Besides the brute-force method, linear time solution can be achieved
# by using hashset to store all the values from the input, looping through
# the range to see which numbers are available. However, this also requires
# constant space memory for the hashset. There are two solutions that can
# solve this problem using constant space AND linear time.

# Solution 1: Bit Manipulation

# When we perform XOR bit operation on two identical numbers, we get zero:
# Ex:     1 0 0 0 1 0
#         1 0 0 0 1 0
#       --------------
#     ==> 0 0 0 0 0 0

# Solution 2: Gauss Formula Sum - Actual Sum
