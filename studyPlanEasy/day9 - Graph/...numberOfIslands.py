# Can be solved simply using dfs/bfs, but I will attempt to solve this using
# union find algorithm...

# UPDATE - Union find is more suitable for problems where provided input is
# adjacency list / edge list. Otherwise, we'll need to convert the grid so
# we can perform union find, which itself is a dfs operation... So don't
# use union find if the input is grid!
